# JavaFX-FinalYearModuleSelector

Final Year Module Selection Tool

Welcome to the Final Year Module Selection Tool repository! This project was created as part of my second-year coursework for Computer Science at university. The goal was to develop a Java application using the JavaFX library to enable students to create profiles, select modules for their final year, and generate an output with their selected options. The project adheres to the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern for creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In accordance with the brief, no data should flow directly from the model to the view; all data should be handled by the controller.
